rewrite builtins as AST nodes
 - avoid all the hash lookups at runtime
 - allow agressive streamlining / static checking

compile-time optimizations
 - should be easier with a real (python!) AST
 - add type annotations

type-aware pipeline functions
pipe-aware pipeline functions
 - that is, 'sort | tail 1' should condense to 'max'
 - related "Stream Fusion" and "deforestation"

even more test cases!
scan/split
'prelude'-style stdlib in Plumbum
